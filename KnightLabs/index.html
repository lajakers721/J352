<h1> The Game of "Survivor" </h1>

<p> The show "Survivor" first premiered in 2000. The first season saw a group of 16 people from all across the United States be stranded in Borneo. They were split into two tribes, the Tagi and Pagong tribe. The castaways were forced to survive the elements of the jungle and co-exist. Every couple days they would have a challenge, either reward or immunity. The winners of the immunity challenge were safe while the losers had to go to tribal council and vote one member of their tribe out. After a little bit, the two tribes became one as the players begin to compete individually. Around half of the eliminated players served as the first ever jury and voted for the winner out of the last two standing on day 39. The person with the most votes at the final tribal council won the game, with the first ever winner being Richard Hatch. Since then there have been 47 more seasons with season 48 airing right now which follow the same general format.</p>


<p> The game has seen a ton of evolutions over time which should be expected for a show of its age. The evolution and aging of the host Jeff Probst is a good example of this. This is what he looked like in the early seasons compared to the recent Survivor: 46.

<p> Like previously mentioned, over the course of 25 years, the game has seen some drastic changes. Some of these changes have lasted, some have not. This timeline shows some of the major evolution points that occurred in just the first twenty seasons:
