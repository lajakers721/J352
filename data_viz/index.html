<h1> Has the NBA's rookie of the year award fallen off? </h1>
<subhead> By Jake Ballard </subhead>
<br>
<br>

<p>Usually the rookie of the year is one of the most highly coveted trophies when NBA awards season comes around. It has a history of marking some of the next big stars in the NBA as legends like Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Tim Duncan and Larry Bird have won it in the past. This NBA awards season though, the discussion around Rookie of the Year has been relatively quiet as this rookie class has not built up a lot of buzz. The most amount of buzz it all season was near the start when Philadelphia 76ers rookie Jared McCain was averaging 15.3 points per game, but once a knee injury sidelined McCain, it went quiet again. Recently, the NBA announced the finalists for every award and for rookie of the year the finalists were Spurs guard Stephon Castle, Hawks forward Zaccharie Risacher and Grizzlies forward Jaylen Wells. Castle averaged 14.7 points per game, Risacher averaged 12.6 and Wells averaged 10.4. With the lack of hype around this class, it begs the question how do they compare to the years past.</p>

<p> The data visualization above holds the points per game for every rookie of the year winner since the year 1980. Castle, Risacher and Wells' stats are not included, but the connection to the graph is easy to make. The highest is the 1985 winner which is Michael Jordan with an insane 28.2 ppg as a rookie and none of these rookies come close to that. The lowest comes from the 2017 season where Malcolm Brogdon averaged 10.2 Wells is only 0.2 away from those numbers and Risacher is only 2.4 away. The average points per game for all of these winners is 18.7, which none of the candidates this year hits. Despite this, over twenty of these winners were over that average. With that being said, over 20 of these winners averaged below 18.7 and so it is not too far off it someone like Stephon Castle wins the award. It is additionally hard to compare different eras within the NBA as the league is different, so lets look at the past 10 winners of the award. </p>

<p> In terms of the last 10 winners, Stephon Castle would not stand out like a sore thumb. He is near the averages of LaMelo Ball, Scottie Barnes and Ben Simmons and is ahead of Brogdon like previously mentioned. This of course is only looking at points per game and if you add the other numbers to the mix, all of them have even more solid cases. Additionally, if you look at this group, the only winner who has not made an all-star team is Malcolm Brogdon, which means it bodes well for whoever the winner might be. If you are curios on my opinion, the person who should win is Stephon Castle. He stepped up for the Spurs when Victor Wembanyama and De'Aaron Fox went down with injury and has consistently been the best scorer since McCain's injury.
