<p> The NFL Honors is where the best of the best  are rewarded for their hard work throughout the season, but recently, some of the major awards have begun to swing towards becoming just for quarterbacks at least in the eyes of the fans. </p>
<p> Has the MVP and other NFL awards actually swung towards being quarterback favored or is it just an idea in fans heads?</p>
<p> These awards are decided by the Associated Press and the most prestigious award of them all is the Most Valuable Player. Alongside that, quarterbacks are eligible for other awards, most notably the Offensive Player of the Year and the Offensive Rookie of the Year award. </p>
<p> It makes sense for a quarterback to win the Most Valuable Player award as they take almost every offensive snap during a game, but that does not mean other positions are not valuable. Looking at the history of the award though, running back Adrian Peterson was the last non-quarterback to win it in 2012. The closest since then were defensive lineman J.J. Watt in 2014 and running back Todd Gurley in 2017 who both finished second, according to <a class="link" href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/ "target="_blank">Pro Football Reference</a>.</p>

<p> The Offensive Player of the Year award has served as a non-quarterback alternative to MVP but even then quarterbacks are eligible and, on occasion, win the award. </p>
<p>The drought of different positions winning the award have made NFL fans turn against the idea of a quarterback winning and encourage the idea of players of other positions winning the award. This recently happened in the past couple years as running backs Christian McCaffrey and Saquon Barkley had incredible years and many fans believed they deserved MVP for their work, but it still went to Lamar Jackson and Josh Allen respectively.</p>

<div class="large-12 medium-12 small-12 background cell">
<p> To understand the truth of whether these awards lean towards quarterbacks, the amount of awards won by them and other positions must be broken down.</p></div>

<p> As shown in the pie chart above, quarterbacks have dominated the MVP award, winning 71.93% of them since 1970 with the next highest being running backs with 22.81%. The only players to not be a quarterback or running back to win the award were kicker Mark Moseley in 1982, linebacker Lawrence Taylor in 1986 and defensive tackle Alan Page in 1971, making up only 5.26% of the data.</p>
<p>This means that, historically, it has ran true that the award does favor the quarterback, but the concerns might have been bolstered as of late. Currently, the award is on its longest streak, since 1970, of quarterbacks winning it. Josh Allen's win this year pushed that streak to 12 in a row. This likely means that it has not been as big of a problem in the past because the non-qb drought has not gone on this long before.</p>

<p> The charts above show the positional breakdown for the two other major awards in this discussion: Offensive Rookie of the Year and Offensive Player of the Year. These show heavy variance from the MVP pie chart. 
<p> For Offensive Rookie of the Year, another award that is more open, it is more dominated by running backs as they take up 60% of the awards since 1970. Additionally, quarterbacks and wide receivers only have a 3.64% difference between them. So, the Offensive Rookie of the Year does not fulfill the idea that quarterbacks win everything. </p>
<p> Although the Offensive Player of the Year gives off the appearance of the best player to not be a quarterback award, it still has 37.74% of its winners being quarterbacks. Some of them make sense and clearly warrant the award like Peyton Manning's statistically insane 2013 season, but fans still encourage this to go to non-qbs as well likely as a result of the MVP being so heavily dominated by quarterbacks.</p>
<p>The idea that quarterbacks dominate the MVP is not just an idea in the fans minds as quarterbacks have historically dominated. The idea of quarterbacks winning every award in general though does not have the same support historically as running backs have predominatly won others like Offensive Player of the Year. The want for a non-quarterback to win is bolstered by the recent dominance of quarterbacks in the MVP race which creates the idea that they win everything in sight.</p>
